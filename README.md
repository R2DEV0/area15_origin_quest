Today, AREA15 is a world-class, science-fiction amusement park… but what was this building before it became a state-of-the-art immersive playground? Join the Multiverse Maintenance crew to uncover the mysterious origins of what’s now one of Vegas’ top entertainment destinations.

Meet Newt and Ritchie: longtime staff in AREA15’s Multiverse Maintenance department. They’re the folks responsible for plugging pocket portals, mopping plasma puddles, and generally corralling cosmic anomalies. Recently, they’ve picked up some strange signals on AREA15’s systems. Someone is trying to contact them – and they need your help to figure out who and why.

Communicate with Newt and Ritchie on your phone as you explore AREA15. Solve puzzles at six stations, all of which are relics from AREA15’s past. Along the way, you’ll unlock long-buried secrets about Particle A15 – the force that makes this place so special – and piece together the story of how AREA15 came to be.
